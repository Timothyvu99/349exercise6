1.) What were some of the challenges you encountered?

The first problem when creating the calculator was getting used to the new features that React provides and the 
slightly different syntax required to create the components. The second problem was trying to figure out how to 
calculate the math from the screen.


2.) Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM. List out a few differences.

Real DOM:
    - It is the actual structure of the webpage.
    - React Update complete document in the Real DOM.
    - React DOM is the actual webpage rendered on the browser any changes made directly reflect on the complete 
      webpage.
    - It represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each branch of the tree 
      ends in a node and each node contains objects.
    - All UI components need to be re-rendered for every DOM update.

Virtual DOM:
    - It is the virtual representation of Real DOM.
    - React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM.
    - It is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do changes in the blueprint but those 
      changes will not directly apply to the machine.
    - It makes the performance faster, not because the processing itself is done in less time. The reason is the 
      amount of changed information â€“ rather than wasting time on updating the entire page, you can dissect it 
      into small elements and interactions.


3.) What are some problems that React can solve for us?

React is fast, simple, and scalable. It allows us to create web applications that can change data without having to 
reload the page. It is also modular so that it allows us to reuse old code for other websites.
